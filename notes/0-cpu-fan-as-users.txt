I was inspired to create this website by <hunter.computer>. 

The website of today is hidden behind several layers of proxies and virtualization,
with the goal being "more on one". Slower Internet is a process of cultivating a garden of machines that fit localized, individual desires.
This is not a radical idea - 

Such a world
instills apathy due to obscurity towards technology. The spinning CPU fan brings me one step
and my closer to real humans.

# Components
1. ESP 8266: Bought this after a series of stolen bikes and shoes at iitb. The 
utopian plan was to create a network of nodes to track my bike at all times.
- I then bought a bike lock for Rs. 700 and my great technological idea
was rendered useless by 3 feet of reinforced rubber and a combination lock.
And so i gained one tiny microcontroller, waiting to be used.

2. Asus Fan 
Remnants from a failed fan replacement using my old laptop.
