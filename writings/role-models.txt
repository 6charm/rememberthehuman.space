# Role Models
Study from afar hardly works, you're seeing the results and outcomes.
Therefore your desire to "be like someone" you have only seen online
is bound to cause anxiety - you'll chasing an outcome while they are 
just ~living.

Rick Rubin says it. <> bunch of others say it.


In the quest to live well, it has become apparent that we are 
inherently mimetic, so just flow with nature and seek out other humans
to observe. I believe that this is the purpose of picking a role model.

The next question, naturally, is where to look? Human societies are tiered: 
with the first being your family.

My mother, Pritha is an orthodontist. My father, Nikhil, is an exec at an oil
company and did not go to college. I have been involved in computer
systems research since my junior year in undergrad. From a career-building perspective, 
there is very little my parents can do for me.
