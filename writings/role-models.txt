# Role Models
Study from afar hardly works, you're seeing the results and outcomes.
Therefore your desire to "be like someone" you have only seen online
is bound to cause anxiety - you'll chasing an outcome while they are 
just ~living.

Rick Rubin says it. <> bunch of others say it.


In the quest to live well, I have accepted that we are 
mimetic creatures, so just flow with nature and seek out other humans
to observe irl versus spending too much time in a book. I believe that this is the purpose of
picking a role model - person(s) you admire and hope to emulate.

The next question, naturally, is where to look? Human societies are tiered: 
with the first being your family.

My mother, Pritha is an consultant orthodontist. My father, Nikhil's did not go to college and assesses
supply chain risk at a large oil company. I have been involved in computer
systems research - i.e. academic engineering work since my junior year in undergrad. 
From a career-building perspective, there is very little field-specific advice my parents 
could give me. So I am forced to seek out other sources.

The next logical step is trying to learn from my childhood friends - people I'd grown up around.
These people have literally witnessed my growth from an anxiety-stricken ball of raw emotions
to someone with far greater ability to channel that great energy. The issue in my case, however, 
is that again - with them being older and moving to university - I was stranded again.

Two years later, I joined university as well. This is supposed to be the place
where there is an abundant presence of potential role models. For me, and most
whose uni years were eaten away by the lockdown, uni was a massive lesson coping with social
isolation.
