I'm the son of a orthodontist and a oil-manager who never went to college. The closest relative
I have - my maternal grand-uncle - was a nuclear physicist at the BARC (Bhaba aAtomic Research Center).
And here I am, educated in computer science, attempting to best predict what living well 
means to me. 

"Role Model" is literally the union of its component words.

To me the value of a role model - by its definition - is to provide an example of an individual 
to aspire to.


# The problem of incomplete information
"How do you choose a role model?"
- Choice of role model(s) is based on what you believe is "living well".
